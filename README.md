# Star Wars API
Using SQL I made calculations and created a table that contained the following:
- Film Title
- Day of the week
- Date
- The days since the film has been released
- The weeks since the film has been released
- The gross takings for that day
- The percent chage from the prior day
- The count of theaters showing the film that day
- The average takings per theater for the day
- The gross takings as a running sum
